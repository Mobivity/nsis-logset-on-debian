SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR LZMA COMPRESSION MODULE
---------------------------------------------

Igor Pavlov and Amir Szekely, the authors of the LZMA compression module
for NSIS, expressly permit you to statically or dynamically link your code
(or bind by name) to the files from the LZMA compression module for NSIS
without subjecting your linked code to the terms of the Common Public
license version 1.0. Any modifications or additions to files from the
LZMA compression module for NSIS, however, are subject to the terms of
the Common Public License version 1.0.

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
warranty.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
      documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

      i) changes to the Program, and

      ii) additions to the Program;

      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
      and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
      'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
      by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
      behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
      (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
      with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
      are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
      license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
      publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of
      such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
      code and object code form.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
      shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
      if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
      such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
      covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
      apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No
      hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
      the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
      entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
      for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement
      of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
      exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
      hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
      license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      b) its license agreement:

      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
      warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
      or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
      or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
      purpose;

      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
      for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
      consequential damages, such as lost profits;

      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
      offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
      such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
      reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
      software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
      the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding
combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given
a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under
which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in
the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
