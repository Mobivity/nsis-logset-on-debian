2.16

    Released on April 7th, 2006

Release Notes

    * The script compiler, makensis, builds and works on big-endian platforms.
      This change enlarges the portability range of NSIS to theoretically every
      POSIX platform. Please report any incompatibility with specific platforms
      or build-tools.
    * The internal changes made to support big-endian platforms also pave the
      road to x64 installers. There is now a central function which writes data
      to disk. This function currently only converts the endianity of integers,
      but it can be changed to selectively write 64-bit integers. Hopefully,
      there'll soon be a simple method of compiling a script to both x86 and
      x64 installers.
    * Changing Source/exehead/fileform.h to alter the internal structure of
      installers is no longer enough. The compiler has its own definitions of
      the structures which must also be changed in Source/fileform.cpp. In the
      future, fileform.cpp should be automatically generated from fileform.h,
      but for now, the synchronization must be done manually.

Major Changes

    * Big-endian platforms are now fully supported by makensis
    * Library now available on non-Windows platforms as well, although it
      requires the installed DLL to have version information
    * MakeNSISW_2.1: added &quot;Cancel compilation&quot; menu item

      #1448176), added MUI_HEADER_TRANSPARENT_TEXT for transparent header texts
      (RFE_#1447766)

2.0 Release Candidate 1

    Released on Decemeber 27th, 2003

Release Notes

    * Trying the LZMA compression method for your installer is recommended. It
      often gives a 20% better compression ratio.
    * Modern_UI_1.68: The setting to change the title size on the Welcome page
      and Finish page has been changed

Major Changes

    * LZMA compression support. Added SetCompresssorDictSize.
    * Modern_UI_1.68: New settings for extra space for title and text on
      Welcome page and Finish page, improved handling of verbose settings,
      language file string for uninstaller reboot information, more
    * Shell folders are now detected using shell API functions and not the
      registry. This is the recommended method by Microsoft. New constants have
      been added in the process ($FONTS, $SENDTO and more...). See section
      4.2.3 for more details.
    * Added LogicLib to distribution (easier conditional execution etc.)
    * Added DirVerify and GetInstDirError to allow custom error checking when
      the installation directory is invalid or the drive does not have enough
      space
    * Support for reading environmental variables on compile time:
      $%envVarName%
    * Added /SD parameter for MessageBox. Allows to set default for silent
      installers.

2.0 Beta 4

    Released on November 19th, 2003

Release Notes

    * The /LANG parameter is no longer available for any text setting
      instructions. You must use a LangString if you want to make a certain
      text multilingual. This means you can also set one text for all
      languages. To make the license data multilingual you should use
      LicenseLangString.
    * Modern_UI_1.67: Because of the new syntax for pages, renaming of settings
      and variable names etc., you have to make some changes to your scripts,
      see the Modern_UI_Readme for details.
    * Custom_Pages now have a leave function. As this parameter is placed
      before the caption you have to add another &quot;&quot; empty string for
      the title to work.
    * .onSelChange is no longer called when the components page is created.
    * The icons folder has been renamed to Graphics and was reorganized. If you
      were using any files from Contrib\Icons in your script, you should update
      it to point to the new image or icon path.
    * UpgradeDLL has been changed, it's highly recommend that you include the
      new version in your script using !include &quot;UpgradeDLL.nsh&quot;
      instead of the old one.
